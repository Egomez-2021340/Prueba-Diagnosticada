            Tommy is the younger brother of Joel. Is a former soldier, he was with the fireflies in the past,
            because he thougth the fireflies were going to change the world, but it wasn't like that. He is
            idealistic and hopeful for a better world. He is also a skilled hunter and fighter.
            <br><br>
            He founded a community in Jackson, Wyoming, where he and Joel live in peace after the events within the
            series.

            In the first episode, we see Tommy and Joel during the outbreak. They are trying to get to Sarah, Joel's
            daughter, but they are unsuccessful. This experience leaves Tommy traumatized and determined to find a way
            to stop the infection.
            <br><br>
            In the sixth episode, we see Tommy reunited with Joel after 20 years. This is a joyous occasion, but it is
            also uncomfortable. Tommy has changed a lot in the past two decades, and he is no longer the idealistic young
            man that Joel remembers. Tommy is now married with a character named Maria
