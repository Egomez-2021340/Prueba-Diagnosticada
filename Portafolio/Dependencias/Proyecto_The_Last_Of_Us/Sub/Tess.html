            Tess is a survivor of the Cordyceps infection outbreak, and she has seen the worst that the world has to
            offer. She is not afraid to kill to protect herself or her loved ones, but she also has a strong sense of
            morality. She is willing to help others, even if it means putting herself at risk, that is the reason why
            she didn't worried about give her life to protect for Joel and Ellie in the capitol.
            <br><br>
            A lot of infecteds were going to the location of Joel, Tess and Ellie, but Tess reveal she was bitten a
            couple of minutos ago, so she wants to save Joel and Ellie, blowing up the entire place.
            <br><br>
            Tess's relationship with Joel is one of the most important in the game. They are partners in crime, but they
            are also friends. Tess knows Joel better than anyone else, and she is the only one who can truly understand
            him.
            <br><br>
            Tess's death is one of the most emotional moments in The Last of Us, and her death is a reminder of the
            harsh realities of the post-apocalyptic world.
