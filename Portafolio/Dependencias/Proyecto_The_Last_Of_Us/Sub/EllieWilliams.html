                Ellie Williams is a survivor within the world of The Last of Us, she is a young woman who grew up within
                the walls of a FEDRA headquarters, she never liked living there, she fought constantly.
                <br><br>
                One night her best friend, Rilley, came to her room after having escaped, she told Ellie that she joined
                the Fireflies, a group of rebels who fight against FEDRA, she joined because she knew that in FEDRA
                they did nothing more than educate in such a way that you grow as a soldier.
                <br><br>
                Ellie becomes a very special component within this world, since she was bitten by an infected, but she
                never became one of them, unlike everyone else, she was immune to the Cordyceps fungus. This led her to
                be captured by the fireflies, they plan to make a cure against the fungus based on her metabolism, this
                leads her to meet Marlene, the leader of the fireflies, she tells her that someone will take her to a
                meeting point to be able to take her to the University of Eastern Colorado, where a possible cure is
                being investigated.
                <br><br>
                Joel Miller and Tess Servopoulo will be the ones who take Ellie to the meeting
                point, but everything goes wrong, when they find the group they would meet with dead, killed by infected
                people who were in the place.
