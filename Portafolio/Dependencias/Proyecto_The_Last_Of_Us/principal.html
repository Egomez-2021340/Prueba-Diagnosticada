        <h2><u>Â¿What is The Last of Us about?</h2></u>

        <p>As clarified before, <b>The Last of Us</b> it is a game that was devastated by a pandemic caused by the
            fungus.
            <b>Cordyceps</b>,
            which, when infecting humans, turns them into its slaves, keeping them alive but unconscious. The fungus
            reproduces by biting other humans, and when bitten, they turn into cannibalistic beasts whose sole
            objective is to bite other people.
